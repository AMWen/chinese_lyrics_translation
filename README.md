# chinese_lyrics_translation
This was a quick project with web scraping and regularized expressions to find a random Chinese song, get the lyrics and corresponding Youtube video, provide word-by-word pronunciations and translations, and email the compiled results.

This could be combined with a job scheduler such as crontab to automatically send translations for a random song each day for daily language learning.
